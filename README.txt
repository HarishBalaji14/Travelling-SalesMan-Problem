Title: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) Solver in Python

Description:
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic optimization problem in the field of computer science and mathematics. 
It can be described as follows: Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, 
the task is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the original city. 
Solving the TSP is crucial in various real-world applications, such as logistics, route planning, and circuit design.
